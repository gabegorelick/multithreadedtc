/**
 * <b>MultithreadedTC</b>: This package provides a unit 
 * testing framework for concurrent applications.
 * 
 * <p>
 * It provides a class {@link edu.umd.cs.mtc.MultithreadedTestCase} 
 * that makes it easy to define a test case that has multiple threads, 
 * and tools to assist in evaluating the behavior of the 
 * code under difference scenarios. 
 * 
 * <p>
 * In particular, it provides a metronome framework for coordinating the
 * actions in multiple threads, and a way to force wait and await calls
 * to immediately return, testing various concurrency scenarios.
