===== INTRO =====

Here is an attempt to rewrite some of the TCK tests for JSR 166, 
using the MultithreadedTC framework. 

This folder is an Eclipse Project. The tests should be run with 
Java 6 and JUnit 4.

The MultithreadedTC tests are for proof-of-concept only (i.e. to show 
that MultithreadedTC can express all the tests in JSR 166.) They are 
not meant to replace the TCK tests. (Indeed this would not make sense 
since MultithreadedTC relies on several classes in java.util.concurrent, 
including some that are tested by these TCK tests!)

The Concurrency JSR-166 Interest Site is at
http://g.oswego.edu/dl/concurrency-interest/

The latest TCK tests are at 
http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/jsr166/src/test/tck/

(This version was downloaded in early 2007)

This project ONLY includes the TCK tests that require more than 1 thread.
There are 258 such tests.


===== RUNNING TESTS =====

The package 'tckversion' is the original version of all 258 tests. The best
way to run it is by running 'tckversion.JSR166TestCase' as a JUnit suite 
(it collects all the other tests in the package).

The package 'mtcversion' is the rewritten MultithreadedTC version. Again
the best way to run it is by running 'mtcversion.JSR166TestCase'.

Some of the tests have my comments as I was writing and doing research.
One interesting test is 'mtcversion.LockSupportTest.TUnitTestPark2' (see 
the comments above this test).

I have not rigorously run all these tests on different platforms, and sometimes
even the original tests fail.
